# Sql set operators

### Set operators combine the results of two component queries into a single result. Queries containing set operators are called compound queries.


| Operator  | Returns |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Union  | All distinct rows selected by either query  |
| Union all  | All rows selected by either query, including all duplicates  |
| Intersect  | All distinct rows selected by both queries  |
| Minus  | All distinct rows selected by the first query but not the second  |
